# AGAMAAFTG
To install, download all the files in AGAMANEW and make a dll library from this. To do this, go to VS and make a new dll. put all the files into the directory of the new project and make sure all code is in the c++ directory. Turn off precompiled headers and ensure you have set up gsl correctly.  gsl can be installed by installing vcpkg, and then installing gsl from vcpkg. edditing environmentale vairbale by adding the path to be the directory to the vcpg folder and then gsl will always work. Then build as a dll and import into code (or just copy AGAMANEW into directory of your project and set up the directory to include contents of AGMANEW and AGAMANEW/Torus).
