# AGAMAAFTG
To install, download all the files in AGAMANEW and make a dll library from this. To do this, go to VS and make a new dll. put all the files into the directory of the new project and make sure all code is in the c++ directory. Turn off precompiled headers and ensure you have set up gsl correctly. Then build as a dll and import into code (or just copy AGAMANEW into directory of your project and set up the directory to include contents of AGMANEW and AGAMANEW/Torus).
